Currently, Extra Utilities contains connected textures for gravel brick, but only makes use of gravel_brick.png

If and when the mod author enables connected textures for gravel bricks, they will no longer render properly when using this texture pack. In that case, swap gravel_brick.ong and gravel_brick_corners.png to fix the issue.
